        <h1>Israel fight in Gaza</h1>
        <p>There will be no security or stability in the Middle East <i>without</i> the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president said Thursday, in <i>response</i> to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's <i>dismissal</i> of the idea. Netanyahu on Thursday said the idea of <i>creating</i> a Palestinian state would clash with the security of Israel â€” remarks at odds with the stance of many countries, including the United States.</p>
        <p>Rudeineh also <b>claimed</b> the US "bears <i>responsibility</i> for the deterioration of security and stability in the region due to its bias and blind support for the Israeli occupation." US President Joe Biden has long advocated <b>for</b> a two-state solution <b>to</b> the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. US officials said Thursday they would not <b>allow</b> Netanyahu's apparent rejection of an eventual Palestinian <b>state</b> to stop them from pressing the matter with their Israeli counterparts.</p>
